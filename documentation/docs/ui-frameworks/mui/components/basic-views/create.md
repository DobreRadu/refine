`<Create>` provides us a layout to display the page. It does not contain any logic but adds extra functionalities like action buttons and giving titles to the page. The Create component is a great way to get started with building your own pages. All you need to do is add your own content and logic.

We'll show what `<Create>` does using properties with examples.

## Properties

### `actionButtons`

### `saveButtonProps`

### `resource`

### `isLoading`

### `cardProps`

### `cardHeaderProps`
